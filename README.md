# Data Analyst Portfolio
I began my career as a scientific researcher in academia, agriculture, and environmental fields, where I learned how to design experiments, collect data and work with complex datasets to uncover meaningful patterns. I am currently transitioning into a data analyst role and specialize in transforming raw data into clear insights that drive data decision-making. 

This portfolio contains a curated selection of projects that demonstrate end-to-end analytical skills: data extraction, cleaning/ETL, exploratory analysis, visualization, and communicating results for stakeholders.
